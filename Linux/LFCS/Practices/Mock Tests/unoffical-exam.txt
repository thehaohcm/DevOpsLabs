Question 1:
Write the Linux Kernal release into /opt/course/1/kernel
# uname -r > /opt/course/1/kernel

Write the current value of Kernel parameter ip_forward into /opt/course/1/ip_forward
# sysctl -a | grep "ip_forward" | tr "ip_forward" "" > /opt/course/1/ip_forward

Write the system timezone into /opt/course/1/timezone
# date +%Z > /opt/course/1/timezone
OR
# cat /etc/timezone > /opt/course/1/timezone
OR
# datetimectl | grep "Time zone" 

Question 2:
On server data-001, user asset-manager is responsible for timed operations on existing data. Some changes and addtions are necessary.
Currently there is one system-wide cronjob configured that runs every day at 8:30pm. Convert it from being a system-wide cronjob to one owned and exected by user asset-manager. This means that user should see it when running crontab -l.
Create a new cronjob owned and executed by user asset-manager that runs bash /home/asset-manager/clean.sh every week on Monday and Thursday at 11:15am.
# ssh data001
# vi /etc/crontab
remove the line defines "30 20 * * * ..."
# crontab -e -u asset-manager
30 20 * * * bash /home/asset-manager/generate.sh
15 11 * * 1,4 bash /home/asset-manager/clean.sh
# crontab -l

Question 3:
Time synchronisation configuration needs to be updated:
1. set 0.pool.ntp.org and 1.pool.ntp.org as main NTP servers
2. set ntp.ubuntu.com and 0.debian.pool.ntp.org as fallback NTP servers
3. The maxium pool interval should be 1000 seconds and connection retry 20 seconds
