Question 1: What command would find files and directories modified in the last 5 minutes in /dev directory?
Answer: find /dev -mmin -5

Question 2: What command removes the write permission for the group from a file?
Answer: chmod g-w some_file

Question 3: Find files/directories under /var/log/ directory that the group can write to, but others cannot read or write to it. Save the list of the files/directories (with complete parent path) in /home/bob/data.txt file.
You can use the redirection to save your command's output in a file i.e [your-command] > /home/bob/data.txt
To make this easier to understand, the logic of the command can be broken down like this:
-> Permissions for the group have to be at least w. If there's also an extra r or x in there, it will still match.
-> Permissions for others have not to be r or w. That means, if any of these two permissions, r or w match for others, the result has to be excluded.

Question 4: Find our secret file under /home/bob. You can either look for a file that is exactly 213 kilobytes or a file that has permission 402 in octal.

You can use the redirection to save your command's output in a file i.e [your-command] > /home/bob/secfile.txt
