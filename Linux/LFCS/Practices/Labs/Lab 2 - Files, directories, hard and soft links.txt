Question 5: Absolute paths always start out with the root directory /. Then we specify the sub-directories we want to descend into, /home/bob/Documents/Invoice.pdf is an example of such a path. In this case, first home, then bob, then Documents. We can see the sub-directory names are separated by a / and we finally get to the file we want to access i.e Invoice.pdf. An absolute path can end with the name of a file or a directory.
As per the example given above If we'd want to delete the Documents directory, how would we specify the path?
Answer: /home/bob/Documents

Question 17: Create a directory named 9 under /tmp/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8 directory. Please note that the structure of sub-directories, from 1 to 8 does not exist. However, mkdir has a command line option to automatically create all of these sub-directories automatically in one shot, instead of 9 consecutive commands. This option is described in the help output or manual pages as make parent directories as needed. Find out what the correct option is and use it to create the directory in one shot.
Answer:
# mkdir -p /tmp/1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9

At what exact time was important_file created/modified?
Answer:
# ls -l --full-time important_file
-> choose the correct time
