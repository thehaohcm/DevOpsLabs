SELinux looks like a virtual jail, hacker cannot do anything outside of the boundaries

Get SELinux permission of specific file/folder:
# ls -Z /path/file
A result:
[user]:[role]:[type]:[level]
ex:
unconfined_u:object_r:uder_home_t:S0

Get processes with SELinux label & context:
# ps auxZ

Notice:
- Every Linux user logged into a system is mapped to SELinux user as part of SELinux policy configuration
4 Important things:
- Only certain users can enter a certain roles and a certain types
- It lets authorized users & processes do their jobs, by granting the permissions they need
- Authorized users and processes are allowed to take only a limited set of actions
- Everythings else is denied

Change SELinux context for a certain files, ex: to httpd_sys_content_t
Change Type:
# chcon -t [typename] [file]
Change User:
# chcon -u [username] [file]
Change Role:
# chcon -r [role] file]
Ex:
# chcon -t httpd_sys_content_t [file]

Set SELinux status:
# setenfore [1|0]
1: Enforcing
0: Permissive

Get SELinux status:
# getenforce

Notice: setenforce cmd is not a permanent way.
To change it persistently, we can edit the enforce in the file
# vi /etc/selinux/config

Show all user label of SELinux:
# seinfo -u
Role label:
# seinfo -r
Type label:
# seinfo -t

Relabel SELinux:
# selinux - active
