Hard Drive -> Partitions -> Physical Volumes -> Volume Group -> Logical Volumes -> File Systems

1st step: get hard drive info: fdisk (-l [hard_disk_name])
2nd step: create a partion from hard disk: 
  + fdisk [hard_disk_name]
  + type 'm' to show all command
  + type 'n' to create a new partition 
  + type 'p' for creating a primary partition
  + type a number in range 1-4 to create a partion with name /dev/[partition_name][1-4] (ex: /dev/sdb3)
  + type 'w' to persist a partion
3rd step: create a physical volume: pvcreate /dev/[pv_name]
4th step: create a volume group: vgcreate [vg_name] [pv_name]
5th step: create a logical volume: lvcreate -L [size] -n [lv_name] [vg_name]
6th step: create a new file system: mkfs.ext3 /dev/[vg_name]/[lv_name]
7th step: mount logical volume:
  + create new dir for mounting logical volume: mkdir [path and name of the new dir]
  + mount a dir to a logical volume: mount /dev/[vg_name]/[lv_name] [dir_path]
  
Increase/Decrease capacity of logical volume:
  lvextend -L [-/+][size] /dev/[vg_name]/[lv_name]
  resize2fs /dev/[vg_name]/[lv_name]
  
Check all mounted directories:
  lsblk
  df -h
  
Remove a logical volume:
  umount /dev/[vg_name]/[lv_name]
  lvremove /dev/[vg_name]/[lv_name]

Remove a volume group:
  vgremove /dev/[vg_name]
  
Remove a physical group:
  pgremove /dev/[pg_name]

Check info:
+ physical volume: pvdisplay ([pv_name])
+ volume group: vgdisplay ([vg_name])
+ logical volume: lgdisplay ([lg_name])
