By default, linux prevent to expose a port number which is less than 1024 (especially when you are using rootless mode)
If you want to expose a port which is less than 1024, follow the below steps:
  # cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_unprivileged_port_start
  # sysctl net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80
  # sysctl -p
