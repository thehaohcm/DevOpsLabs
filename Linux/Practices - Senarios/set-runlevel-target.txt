get current runlevel target:
systemctl get-default

set runlevel target:
system set-default [multi-user.target]

after modifying, reboot the OS:
reboot

Notice:
multi-user.target (or multi-user) = runlevel3.target (or runlevel3)

if you don't want to reboot to affect the new change, can use this command:
systemctl isolate [multi-user]
