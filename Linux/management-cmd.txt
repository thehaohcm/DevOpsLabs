knowledge about some Security kinds existing in Linux:
(more inf: https://kipalog.com/posts/Mo-hinh-phan-quyen---ACL--DAC--MAC--RBAC)

- ACL (Access Control List)
  + Stores all allowed/prohibit resources info-metadata into a file or database for each user
  + The user will be checked its permission in database when they attemp to access a specific resource
  + If the user has no permission => no allow to access
  Example: grant access an user to some tables/DBs in DBMS

- DAC (Discretionary Access Control)
  + Store objects metaddata-info and their owner username into file or database
  + The owner objects can change owner to another user, when changed, the previous owner will not be an owner of the object
  + Permissions of the objects will be set based on owner
  + Example: set owner for file/folder in Unix/Linux OS

- MAC (Mandatory Access Control)
  + Each object has its own label to check permission when a user execute it 
  + Even an owner would not has permission to execute the file if the owner has not been added in object's label
  + Example: SELinux

- RBAC (Role Based Access Control)
  + An User or group can be assigned to one or many Role
  + We can set permission to role (instead of user or group)
  + Very useful if we have to changed permission for a bunch of user/group frequently
  + Example: grant permission for user in AWS...

- ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control)
  + A Resource/Object/User can be assigned to one or many Tag/Attribute
  + We can set permission/policy to tag/attribute, then add permission/policy to user
  + Almost be used in Resources
  + Example: grant resources in AWS...

add a normal user: useradd [username]
add an user without login: useradd -s /sbin/nologin [username]
add an user with specific ID: useradd -u [ID] [username]
add an user and add it into a group: useradd -G [groupname] [username]
add a password into an existing group: 
  + echo "[password]" | passwd --stdin [username]
  + passwd [username] => then enter a password
delete an user: userdel -rf [username]

add a new group: groupadd [groupname]
add a new group with specific ID: groupadd -u [ID] [groupname]
delete a group: groupdel [groupname]

check and list all groups & users: cat /etc/passwd

change user for file/folder: chown [username] [-R] [file/folderpath]
change group for file/folder:
  + chown :[groupname] [file/folderpath]
  + chgrp [groupname] [file/folderpath]

to make sure it work with ACL, we might use the cmd setfacl: 
  + for file: setfacl -m g:[groupname]:rwx [filepath]
  + for folder: setfacl -M g:[groupname]:rwx [folderpath]
verify ACL of file/folder: getfacl [file/folderpath]

set added sub-folder and sub-file in the future will also belongs to a groupname: chown g+x [folder/file]
