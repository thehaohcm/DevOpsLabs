There are 3 options:

option 1:
- reboot the machine, then in the option OS black screen, choose the 1st item, then hit 'e' key to edit
- press a down arrow key to scroll down the text file until see the word 'linux16', then break 'end' key to go to the end of line
- append this text in the end of line ' rd.break'
- press ctr + X to save and reboot
- in the next time when the OS booted, it will show a black terminal screen, type 'mount' and let see the last line with something like '[/sysroot] type xfs (ro,relatime,attr2,inode64,noquota)
- type 'mount -o remount,rw [/sysroot]/'  (sysroot in this exam is a root directory of the OS)
- type 'chroot [/sysroot]/'
- type 'passwd' and type the new password twice
- type 'touch /.autorelabel' (especially when we use SELinux, to avoid messing up the Linux environment when boot in the next time)
- type 'exit' couple times to reboot the machine

option 2:
- reboot the machine, then in the option OS black screen, choose the 1st item, then hit 'e' key to edit
- press a down arrow key to scroll down the text file until see the word 'linux16'
- replace the 'ro' word in this line with a new is 'rw init=/sysroot/bin/sh'
- press ctr + X to save and reboot
- in the next time when the OS booted, it will show a black terminal screen, type below commands:
  + chroot /sysroot
  + passwd root
  + touch /.autorelabel'
  + exit

option 3 (fastest way):
- reboot the machine, then in the option OS black screen, choose the 2nd item (recuse...), then hit 'e' key to edit
- press a down arrow key to scroll down the text file until see the word 'linux'
- replace the 'ro' word with 'rw' and add 'init=/bin/bash' into the end of this line
- press ctr + X to execute and wait for a minute to see a terminal come out, type below commands:
  + passwd root
  + new root password
  + confirm new root password
  + touch /.autorelabel
  + exec /sbin/init
